## Unit I: Introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning

This unit provides a foundational understanding of neural network and how a neural network manages to learn patterns from within data. We will go through various topics, understand libraries and frameworks and implement a neural network from scratch. 

There are various resoruces you can should use and read from online while you follow along, I have linked some of those below for your reference:
